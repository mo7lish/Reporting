Based on what we're seeing in the workspace, it appears the location field is part of private fields near where we see status, but we haven't been able to select it properly. However, the changes we've made so far:

1. Updated import from android.location.Location to com.example.reporting.Location ✓
2. Updated setLocation method parameter type from String to Location ✓
3. Updated constructor initialization from empty string to new Location("0", "0") ✓
4. Fixed ReportAdapter constructor call to remove the showReportDetails parameter ✓

The only remaining change needed is the field declaration type change.
